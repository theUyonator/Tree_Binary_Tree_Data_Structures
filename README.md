# Tree_Binary_Tree_Data_Structures
This repo holds the code to the Tree and Binary Tree Data Structures with a few methods:

**Trees** 
  - Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for Tree:

**sumValues**
  - Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the sum of all the integers.

**countEvens**
  - Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the count of all the even integers.

**numGreater**
  - Given a n-ary tree and a number x, find and return the number of nodes which are greater than x.

**Binary Trees**
  - Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for BinaryTree:

**minDepth**
  - Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**maxDepth**
  - Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**maxSum**
  - Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree, but no node can be visited more than once.

**nextLarger**
  - Given a binary tree and a integer x. Find and return the value of the node with next larger element in the tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than x. Return null if no node is present with value greater than x.
